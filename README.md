# Tutorial: Golang in Workshop on System Design
This repository provides a base project to learn how to write Golang.

This lecture uses Go 1.17.
The lecture provides Docker container and will provide brief information on how to rely on it.

Using your own local development environment is also welcome, but this lecture will not describe how to set up it and Docker container is still recommended because MySQL DB server will be required later.
